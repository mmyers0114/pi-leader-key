# pi-leader-key

Vim-style leader key shortcuts for the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), inspired by OpenCode.
Press the leader key (default `ctrl+space`), then tap a short key sequence to run a slash command, a built-in action, or a shell one-liner.

## Features

- **Leader key with multi-key sequences** — `gs` for git status, `m` for the model picker, whatever you like
- **Bind any slash command** — including commands contributed by other extensions, prompt templates, and skills
- **Three binding types** — slash commands (with arguments), built-in actions, shell one-liners
- **Interactive setup** — `/leader-bind` wizard and `/leader-commands` discovery picker, no JSON hand-editing required
- **Safe config** — survives package updates, never overwrites your file, refuses to clobber corrupt configs

## Why this exists

pi's native `keybindings.json` only remaps a fixed set of built-in action ids (`tui.*`, `app.*` — see pi's `docs/keybindings.md`). A handful mirror built-in commands like `/new` or `/tree`, but there is **no native way to assign a key to an arbitrary slash command**, and no way at all to bind commands contributed by extensions, prompts, or skills. `pi.registerShortcut()` exists but is an extension-author API (it registers a code handler), not user configuration.

This extension fills that gap: one leader key gives you an unlimited namespace of two- and three-key shortcuts to anything invokable in your session.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-leader-key
```

On first startup a blank config is written to `~/.pi/agent/leader-key.json` (outside the package directory, so it survives updates). Add bindings by hand or run `/leader-bind`.

## Quick start

```jsonc
// ~/.pi/agent/leader-key.json
{
  "leaderKey": "ctrl+space",
  "bindings": {
    "c":  { "action": "compact" },
    "m":  { "command": "/model" },
    "gs": { "exec": "git status" }
  }
}
```

Press `ctrl+space`, then `gs` — the shell command runs and its output appears as a notification. Press `ctrl+space`, then `m` — the model picker opens as if you had typed `/model`.

> [!NOTE]
> Restart pi after changing `leaderKey` — the shortcut registers once at startup. Every other setting applies on your next leader press.

## Bind any slash command

Anything you can type after `/` can go behind a key sequence — including commands from any installed package:

```jsonc
{
  "bindings": {
    "ov": { "command": "/om:view" },
    "r1": { "command": "/review:1" },
    "mo": { "command": "/model", "args": "opus" }
  }
}
```

Command bindings run through pi's full editor submit pipeline, exactly as if you had typed the text and pressed Enter — so arguments work too. Put them in the explicit `args` field; the two forms below dispatch byte-identically (`"/model opus"`), and the legacy embedded form keeps loading so existing configs don't break:

> [!TIP]
> Don't guess at command names — run `/leader-commands` to browse everything invokable in your current session, or `/leader-bind` to pick one and bind it in a single flow.

## Finding commands: `/leader-commands`

Opens a scrollable picker over every invokable command in the current session — extension commands, prompt templates, and skills — generated at invocation time, so newly installed packages appear automatically.

- **Type to filter** — fuzzy match over names and descriptions
- Entries show provenance (`extension`, `prompt`, or `skill`) plus the description
- Selecting an entry echoes the exact invokable string (e.g. `/om:view`) to paste into `bindings` — no typos
- **+ Add binding**, the first entry, jumps straight into the `/leader-bind` wizard

In non-TUI mode the list is shown as a plain notification instead. Escape cancels.

## Creating bindings: `/leader-bind`

Walks you through a binding in one overlay: pick a type (`command` / `action` / `exec`), enter the value (fuzzy command picker, action list, or free-text shell input), choose a key sequence, confirm, done.

- Sequences must be printable ASCII with no spaces; command values must start with `/`
- Collisions — exact or prefix overlaps — are shown with the conflicting bindings and require explicit overwrite confirmation
- The merged config is written to `~/.pi/agent/leader-key.json` and works immediately, no reload
- Escape walks back a step; cancelling anywhere writes nothing; a corrupt config file is never overwritten

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| `leaderKey` | `"ctrl+space"` | Combination that activates leader mode. Restart pi after changing it. |
| `leaderTimeoutMs` | `3600` | How long leader mode stays active before timing out. |
| `sequenceTimeoutMs` | `750` | Max wait between keystrokes in a multi-key sequence. Also the delay before a prefix binding fires (see below). |
| `editorEffect` | `"grayedOut"` | Visual indicator while leader mode is active: `"grayedOut"` dims the editor, `"none"` shows a static `LEADER` status instead. |
| `bindings` | `{}` | Sequence → binding. Empty by default; the leader key warns until you add some. |

Invalid values fall back to defaults, and malformed binding entries are ignored — a typo in one binding can't break the rest.

### Binding types

| Type | Example | What it does |
| ---- | ------- | ------------ |
| `command` | `{ "command": "/model" }` | Runs a slash command through pi's full editor pipeline |
| `command` + args | `{ "command": "/model", "args": "opus" }` | Same, with arguments (legacy `{ "command": "/model opus" }` also accepted) |
| `action` | `{ "action": "compact" }` | `compact`, `shutdown`, or `clearEditor` |
| `exec` | `{ "exec": "git status" }` | Runs via `bash -c` (15s timeout); output shown as a notification, capped at 2KB |

> [!NOTE]
> `command` + `args` dispatches the composed string (`command + " " + args`) through the same handler a manual Enter press triggers. Args are opaque: edges trimmed, interior kept verbatim; a legacy `"/model  opus"` (double space) normalizes to `"/model opus"`. Unknown command names pass through untouched — the binding fires against whatever is registered that session, so a command from a removed package simply does nothing until the package is back. Composition, normalization, and draft-restore against the composed string are pinned by unit tests; if a command behaves differently bound than typed, please file an issue.

### Sequences

Keys are printable ASCII: single (`"c"`) or multi-key (`"gs"`). Escape cancels leader mode; non-printable keys are ignored.

A sequence that is also a prefix of a longer binding waits `sequenceTimeoutMs` for the next key: with both `"g"` and `"gs"` bound, leader + `g` pauses briefly for `s` before firing `"g"`.

## Development

```bash
npx tsx __tests__/logic.test.ts   # assert-based suite, no framework
pi install /path/to/this/repo     # load as a local package
```

Pure logic (config loading, key matching, menu building) lives in `logic.ts`, deliberately free of pi imports so the suite loads standalone under tsx. The `@earendil-works/pi-*` peers are declared in `package.json` and resolved by pi at runtime.
